<p class='Data'>

    Yudesi Organic Supplies Ltd was conceptualized in 2020 and has humble beginnings as a cassava farm in Budaka district. As the concept picked up, the company was formally registered with the government of Uganda on 11th February 2022. Yudesi Organic Supplies Ltd is a privately owned limited liability company located in Kebula, Kaderuna, Budaka District. Following years of acting as a trader in dry cassava chips and cassava flour, Maize Flour and Rice, the company intends to setup a factory in Kebula to build the capacity to instantly purchase and process Maize Flour, High Quality Cassava Flour (HQCF) and convert cassava peel waste to High-Quality Cassava Peel Mash (HQCPM) for Animal Feeds. The company is setting up a network of over 400 smallholder contract farmers who will produce and sell to the factory. With the setup of a modern processing factory using modern flash drying technology in Budaka, the company will be able to process and market 50 tons of Flour per day in the early stages of production.

    Uganda is known within the region as a country that is blessed with plenty and a wide variety of food. Food varieties are as many as tribes, ranging from maize, beans, banana, cassava, sweet potatoes, millet, sorghum, rice, field peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, groundnuts, sim sim, soya bean, Irish potatoes to mention but a few.

    However, Uganda faces high levels of food loss and waste (FLW) along critical value chains. This is perpetuating food insecurity and compromising trade competitiveness.  Food losses and wastages arise mainly due to poor post-harvest handling practices and through the absence of adequate and appropriate food infrastructure in harvest and post-harvest systems. For example, during the preparation stages (poor drying leading to high moisture content) storage, transportation and processing.
    Moreover, the majority of the farmers still use rudimentary methods like drying on uncovered ground, storage in sacks or pouring on ground, hand shelling or beating. Drying and storing on ground makes agricultural produce become susceptible to discolouration, and contamination with foreign matters, termite damage, mould and debris

    Storage in inappropriate materials (non-hermetic bags) like bags/sacks makes the stored produce vulnerable to storage pests (like rodents, weevils, termites), contamination by mould and aflatoxin, and insect frass.
    FLW is also caused by the wrong usage of agro-inputs and wrong inputs (pesticides, herbicides, acaricides) during production and storage, and poor processing equipment like grain milling machines that leave particles in the processed flour. We therefore armed the Farmers with the necessary education and the tools, so they could realize their full potential and their vision.
